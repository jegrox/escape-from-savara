# escape-from-savara

This is a simple endless scroller inspired by the old-school computer game Tyrian. It's a top-down scroller where you can control a spaceship while battling different types of enemies.

This project can be updated to support more types of enemies, more types of weapons and powerups.

Another improvement will be to add score tracking capabilities.
